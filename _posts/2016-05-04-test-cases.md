questions for devs

***

  1. How much of the underlying system is third party libraries/code vs. novel code written by Diio employees?
  2. Which of the following languages/parts of the stack, revealed by Chrome plugin "BuiltWith", required the most novel code for this version of the software: Apache, Apache Tomcat Coyote, Google Search Appliance, Facebook SDK, Facebook for Websites, jQuery, Modernizr, Viewport Meta, Google Tag Manager, Tealium, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage?
  3. How is the system represented, architecturally, at a high level?  For reference: [Alternatives to MVC](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/alternatives-to-mvc.html)
  4. What languages, databases, etc. were used in its development?
  5. What were the most difficult or complex parts of the engagement?
  6. Did we touch any parts of the code requiring additional oversight by compliance, security, financial or other stakeholders?
  7. Where's the app's repo?
  8. Were there any major efforts required to make the system compatible across multiple channels (web, mobile, kiosk, etc)?
  9. Did you use any pre-existing specifications or documentation to inform your development decisions?
  10. Were any of your development decisions made specifically to aid testing or the QA process?  If so, which?  If not, can we schedule another meeting to talk about the next version?
